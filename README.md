Eraser.css is a CSS file that uses brute force to reset all critical properties
for elements within an embedded widget.

## What does it do?

* Uses `!important` to override any styles cascading down the document from other sources.

# How to use it

* It is best to use the file as a customisable starting point.
* Replace references to `.x-widget` with the name of your widget.
* Since browsers parse CSS selectors from right to left, you may want to
  customise the selectors in the main reset rule to rely on classes that your
  widget uses.
* Have your widget insert a `link` referencing the `eraser.css`-based CSS.
* Write all your CSS using `!important` for each property.

# (Intended) browser support

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox 3+
* Apple Safari 4+
* Opera 10+
* Internet Explorer 6+
